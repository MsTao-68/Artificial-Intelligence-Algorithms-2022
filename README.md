### About the paper
This paper is the course essay of AI, the research content focuses on ***Pattern Recogniction and Machine Learning***, Feature dimension reduction technology.

### Abstract
In this paper, feature dimension reduction technology in ***Pattern Recogniction and Machine Learning*** is researched. This technology can be divided into features delection and feature extraction. As for feature selection algorithm, branch and bound method (namely, `分枝定界法`) is taken as an example of the complete search algorithm, increasing L and decreasing R method (namely, `增L减R`) is taken as an example of heuristic search algorithm, as well as genetic algorithm (namely, `遗传算法`) is taken as an example of random search algorithm in order to analyze the workflow and efficiency of the algorithm. Besides, the multi-dimensional scale algorithm (namely, `多维尺度算法`) is taken as an example to describe the feature extraction algorithm. And then, comes to application analysis and the development status and trend of feature dimension reduction technology in this field. In the era of deep learning, this technology is still very important.
